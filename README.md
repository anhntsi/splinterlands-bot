# splinterlands-bot

This is my personal project of a BOT to play the game [Splinterlands](https://www.splinterlands.com). It requires [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/it/download/) installed to run.


## How to start the BOT:

REQUIREMENT: You need to install NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

To start BOT login routine. you need to create the .env file and include the username and password (file with no name, only starting dot to create a hidden file) in the root folder, 

Example: 

- `ACCOUNT=youraccountname`
- `PASSWORD=yourpostingpassword`

You can also use the file `.env-example` as a template, but remember to remove `-example` from the filename.


Once the file is created, open cmd (for windows) or terminal (for Mac and Linux) and run:

`npm install`

and then

`npm start`


### Optional variables:

The BOT will make a battle every 30 minutes by default, you can change the custom value specifying in the .env the variable `MINUTES_BATTLES_INTERVAL`.
The BOT will also try to select team to complete the daily quest by default. If you want to remove this option to increase the winning rate, you can set the variable `QUEST_PRIORITY` as false.

Example:

- `QUEST_PRIORITY=false`

- `MINUTES_BATTLES_INTERVAL=30`



## Local History backup (battlesGetData.js)

The BOT leverages an API on a free server but in case the traffic is heavy or it doesn't work, it is possible to have locally an history as a backup solution that the bot will read automatically.
To generate the file 'history.json' with a unique array with the history of the battles of an array of users (to be specified in the file).

[ OPTIONAL ] run this command from the terminal:

`node battlesGetData.js`

Once the script is done, it will create a file 'history.json' in the data folder. To makes the bot using it, you have to rename it in: 'newHistory.json' 

# FAQ


Q: Can I make the bot running a battle every 2 minutes?
A: Technically yes, but playing too often will decrease the Capture Rate making the rewards very low and insignificant. Try to play a battle every 20 minutes MAX to maintain high level of rewards. Trust me, you keep the ROI higher. Don't be greedy.

Q: Does it play for the daily quest?
A: At the moment the bot consider only the splinters quests (death, dragon, earth, fire, life, water) but not the special one (snipe, sneak, neutral,...). Therefore yes, the bot prioritize the splinter for the quest. Nonetheless if the bot consider more probable to win a battle with another splinter (because for example there are not many possible team for the splinter of the quest), you may see a different card selection sometimes

Q: Can I play multiple accounts?
A: Technically yes, but don't be greedy.

Q: I got the error "cannot read property split of undefined"
A: check that the credentials file doesn't contain any but ".env" in the name. (no .txt or anything else) and check that there is nothing but ACCOUNT=yourusername and PASSWORD=yourpass in 2 lines with no spaces. Also you must use the username with the posting key, and not the email address.

Q: Why the bot doesn't use my best card I paid 1000$?
A: Because the bot select cards based on the statistics of the previous battles choosing the most winning team for your cards. it's a bot, not a thinking human being!

Q: Why the bot doesn't use the Furious Chicken?
A: same as above
